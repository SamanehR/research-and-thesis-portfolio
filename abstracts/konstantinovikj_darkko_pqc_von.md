## Abstract

With the rapid advancement towards quantum computing, traditional cryptographic algorithms
face new threats, particularly in dynamic environments such as Vehicular Opportunistic
Networks (VONs). In this thesis we explore the integration of post-quantum cryptographic
techniques to enhance security in vehicular communications. The study begins
with a thorough review of existing literature on both quantum-resistant cryptography and
the specific challenges posed by VONs. Building upon this, a cryptographic authentication
scheme for VONs is proposed, focusing on robustness against quantum attacks
while considering the resource-constrained nature and dynamic topology of vehicular networks.
The algorithm leverages two core post-quantum techonologies: Non-Interactive
Zero-Knowledge Proofs and a Post-Quantum Cryptographic algorithm Dilithium. Analytical
evaluation and performance benchmarking is done on the proposed algorithm to
assess its efficiency and post-quantum resilience. The results aim to contribute valuable
insights into the practical deployment of quantum-resistant cryptography within VONs, addressing
security concerns and resource constraints in future vehicular communication
systems.
