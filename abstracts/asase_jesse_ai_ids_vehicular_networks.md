## Abstract

The interconnectivity of modern vehicles through V2X communication and advanced in-vehicle systems enhanced road safety but also increased cybersecurity risks where traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), reliant on static rule sets, struggled to detect zero-day attacks within the Controller Area Network bus.

This study seeks to develop an AI-driven IDS framework, utilizing machine learning for anomaly detection in CAN traffic by using the X-CANIDS dataset. The study pre-processed signals, engineered features and simulated attack behaviours like spoofing, fuzzing, replay and suspension whereas supervised models, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall and inference time.

Expected findings can show that classical machine learning models achieve high detection performance while remaining computationally efficient, making them viable for vehicular electronic control units (ECUs). The study also seeks to identify challenges in dataset fidelity, model generalizability and real-time feasibility, laying the groundwork for future AI-based IDS deployment in intelligent transportation systems.
