## Abstract

The emergence of quantum computing has become an increasingly significant threat to IT security in general and to classical cryptographic schemes in particular. This concern has grown even more relevant with Microsoft’s announcement of **Majorana 1**, a system designed to scale up to **one million qubits**. Adversaries equipped with a sufficiently powerful quantum system will be able to exploit algorithms such as **Shor’s** and **Grover’s**, enabling them to break current key-exchange mechanisms like **RSA**, **Diffie–Hellman**, and **Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman** with ease.

This vulnerability is especially critical in **delay-tolerant** and **opportunistic networks**, where devices must exchange sensitive data over intermittent, infrastructure-less connections. Ensuring long-term confidentiality and integrity in these challenging environments demands a shift toward **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**.

In this thesis, we design and evaluate a **quantum-resistant key exchange protocol** tailored for **resource-constrained opportunistic environments**. Leveraging lattice-based constructions, we implement a **Learning With Errors (LWE)**–based Key Exchange Mechanism (KEM) to establish secure session keys between nodes during brief contact windows. To further improve integrity, we propose a lightweight authentication scheme combining the **Dilithium digital signature** with a binary-noise variant of Ring-LWE, known as **Ring-BinLWE**, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong security guarantees.

We integrate these cryptographic mechanisms into three common delay-tolerant routing protocols—**Epidemic**, **PRoPHET**, and **Spray-and-Wait**—and evaluate performance using **The ONE Simulator**. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of deploying post-quantum security primitives in highly dynamic, resource-limited environments, offering a foundation for **future-proof secure communication** in mobile, ad hoc, and infrastructure-less networks.
